# FoodHub Data Analysis


## Project Overview
This project analyzes restaurant order data from FoodHub, a food aggregator service in New York. The analysis aims to understand customer preferences, restaurant performance, and delivery efficiency.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer order data to identify popular cuisines and restaurants.
- Evaluate food preparation and delivery times.
- Assess customer satisfaction based on ratings.

## Data Description
- **order_id**: Unique ID of the order
- **customer_id**: ID of the customer who ordered the food
- **restaurant_name**: Name of the restaurant
- **cuisine_type**: Cuisine ordered by the customer
- **cost_of_the_order**: Cost of the order
- **day_of_the_week**: Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or weekend
- **rating**: Rating given by the customer out of 5
- **food_preparation_time**: Time taken by the restaurant to prepare the food
- **delivery_time**: Time taken by the delivery person to deliver the food

## Analysis Methodology
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Statistical Methods**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing
- **Data Visualization**: Created graphs and charts to visualize findings

## Key Findings
- Shake Shack leads in revenue generation.
- Average preparation time is 27 minutes; average delivery time is 24 minutes.
- Most orders are made on weekends, indicating higher demand.
- 89% of orders are delivered within 60 minutes.

## Conclusions
- Shake Shack is the most popular restaurant with the highest revenue.
- Delivery times are generally higher on weekdays.
- Customers are willing to wait an hour for quality food.
- Most orders are made on weekends.

## Recommendations
- Increase offerings of American, Japanese, Italian, and Chinese cuisines.
- Deploy more drivers and chefs on weekends to meet demand.

## Course Information
**Course**: Statistical Methods for Decision Making

This project involved drawing inferences from the FoodHub analysis using various statistical methods. The following concepts were applied:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Analyzing data through measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation to summarize and describe the characteristics of the dataset.
- **Probability**: Understanding the likelihood of events and applying probability rules to interpret data effectively.
- **Estimation**: Utilizing point and interval estimation techniques to infer population parameters based on sample data.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting tests to validate assumptions and claims about the population based on sample data, including Type I and Type II errors, significance levels, and p-values.
